# Taking Notes
Taking notes is **important** simply because when you take something in, you need to be able to put it out just as efficiently; in English, you need to understand it so that you can teach it later on without sounding like a madman. 

It is important to **note** (HAHA) that you need to **put whatever you take in _INTO YOUR OWN WORDS!_**

> :exclamation: **IMPORTANT POINT:** When taking notes, take notes about what you learn **in your own words**

## Note-Taking Guidelines
___
### What You Should Take Notes On
* Big Ideas - Summaries, Overviews or Conclusions etc.
* Use Bullet Lists
* Terms & Definitions e.g. **Taxonomy is the science of grouping species into different categories**
* :exclamation: Examples 
    * Take note of every step used in the example given, so that when an application using the concept the example demonstrated comes along, you aren't stumped and know exactly what to do i.e. When the teacher is demonstrating **_mx + b = y_** using an example, don't just sit there, but follow along with every step they take and write it down. 
    
## How To Take Notes
### The Outline Method
The outline method is the most simple method of taking notes; to use it, you simply make the main idea a top level bullet, then indent as you add more ideas and specifics (most of this is from _Thomas Frank_). 

Example:
JavaScript Notes:
* Variables (Main Point)
  * Variables are simply container of data
  * They can be labeled
  * They can hold multiple data types :point-left: (Specifics)
  
### The Cornell Method
This method is a _little_ more tough to use. You essentially outline 3 different columns/areas calld **Cues, Notes and Summary**. In the notes section, you will take notes on the lecture/lesson you were taking. In the cues section, you will note down keywords, questions that weren't answered or important points that make learning easier. In the summary section :exclamation: **WHICH YOU WON'T TOUCH UNTIL AFTER THE LESSON IS DONE!** :exclamation: you will take a good look at your notes and write down a summary based on those notes. 

Example: 
**Notes:**
  * Point 1 
    * Sub-Point 1
    
**Cues**:
  * If Point 1 signifies change over time, then does that mean time over change?
  * Other stupid questions
  * Delta | Change over time etc.
  * Crash Course | Very useful
  
**Summary**:
In summary, this is the Cornell note-taking method.
