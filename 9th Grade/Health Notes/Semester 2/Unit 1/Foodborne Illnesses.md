# Foodborne Illnesses
## Foodborne Pathogens
A **Foodborne Pathogen** is one which is carried in food i.e. a pathogen carried in meat or a vegetable. 
> **IMPORTANT:** Every foodstuff has some small amount of these pathogens. However, our body is well-equipped to deal with these small amounts. 
when these pathogens enter in a great quantity, then our body is negatively affected.
> **ALSO IMPORTANT:** Cooking food is one well-known way to eliminate pathogens.

:exclamation: Normally you don't have to fear foodborne pathogens unless you don't practice healthy sanitization. 

### Groups At Risk From Diseases Associated With Foodborne Pathogens :sparkles:(Amazing Title):sparkles:
1. Children
    * Reason: Immune systems aren't fully developed.
2. Already Sick
    * Reason: Their immune systems are already fighting disease.
3. Elderly
    * Reason: Immune systems deteriorate as you get older. 
  
## Tips To Avoid Foodborne Pathogens & Illnesses
1. Keep meats seperate from other products you purchase.
    * Purchase meats last when shopping:point-left:
2. Inspect canned goods to be **free of dents and bulging lids**. 
3. :bangbang:**Store items within one hour of purchasing them**:bangbang:
4. Make sure your refrigerator is at least **40 degrees Farenheit** and your freezer is at **0 degrees 
Fareneheit**.
5. Store meats, fish and/or poultry at **the bottom** to avoid dripping on other foods. 
6. Wash hands with soap and water for **20 seconds _before & after_** handling raw meat.
7. Clean all equipment that comes in contact with raw food.

## Food Additives
There are two kinds of additives:
1. Indirect Additives:
    * Chemicals/Other additives that become part of the food due to packaging, storing or other handling.
2. Direct Additives:
    * Used by the manufacturer to change the characteristics of the food. 
    * The FDA maintains a list of ~3,000 food additives.
    
People use additives to maintain or improve food safety, improve nutrient value or to improve taste, texture or sweetness.

## Benefits and Risks of Biotechnology
Implies genetic engineering. 

While you can now genetically engineer a product in a lab to meet the standards you want (i.e. peanuts that cause less severe allergic reactions) it doesn't always come out 100% perfect. It can take years to go back fix thie problem.
