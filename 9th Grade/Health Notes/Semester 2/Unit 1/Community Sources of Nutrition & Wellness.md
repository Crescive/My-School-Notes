## Government Nutrition & Wellness Programs
### Notes
* Federal food programs started after the Depression
* Today, the main resources for nutrition and wellness provieded by the government are sponsered by the **USDA**. 
  * > **NOTE**: Federal government programs are listed in the _"Cues"_ section. 

### Cues
* WIC Program | _Women, Infants and Children Program_
  * Aims to help pregnant women and mothers with children upto but not exceeding the age of 5. Services are things like health care referrals, progress checks on growth of the to-be-born baby, nutrition recommendations and checks, looking for potential areas of error and assisting in closing them off etc.
  * This is available in all the 50 states, The Indian Tribes American Samoa, District of Columbia and so on.
* Food Stamps Program
  * These are vouchers given to low-income families that allow them to buy nutritious food from authorized vendors and stores. 
  * These stamps encourage following dietary guidelines and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. 
* School Lunch Program
  * This program is government-sponsored; it makes participating schools feed children lunches for free or reduced prices. These lunches must meet the dietary guidelines outlined by (I believe...) the United States Department of Agriculture. 
* Disaster Relief Program
  * Provides food packages and emergency food stamps (amongst other things) to shelters after a disaster.
* CACFP | _Child and Adult Care Food Program_
  * This program makes it easier for low-income families to leave their kids at daycare (Around 3,000,000 kids every day, I think). It also provides food to adults who live in adult daycare centers, meals to children in shelters, and children who participate in certain after-school programs. 
* Summer Food Service Program
  * Provides free/reduced rate breakfast and lunch to people in low-income areas, usually in the summer months. 


### Summary
The government creates and supports multiple wellness programs for the people it serves. Most of these programs are beneficial and benefit most of the low-income population in some way.
