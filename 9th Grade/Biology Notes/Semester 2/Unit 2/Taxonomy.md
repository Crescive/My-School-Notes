# Taxonomy 
Taxonomy is the art of grouping/classifying and naming organisms. The most modern form of Taxonomy was created by _Robert Whittaker_ and groups species very conclusively. Here are the classifications he uses:

* Kingdom X
  * Phylum X
    * Class X 
      * Order X
        * Family X
          * Genus X
            * Species X
 
> **NOTE:** 'X' here represents an anyonymous classification .

## Naming In Taxonomy
All names in Taxonomy are **in Latin**. 

All species are named using something called a **binomial nomenclature**, which is basically a two-part name; the first part is the genus, the second part is the species name e.g. _Homo sapiens_ is the taxonomical reference to a human. Homo is the genus, and sapien is the species name. 

### Rules for Nomenclature
* All taxa (refers to categorizations) must have an author e.g. _Homo sapiens L_ where the L stands a Lanneus, the man who invented the naming for humans
* The first published name for the species has priority over a correct name e.g. _Brontosaurus_ is the popular but invalid name for an _Apatosaurus_. 
* All taxa must belong to a higher taxonomical group e.g. A family must belong to a higher order. 

## Phylogenetic Trees
What in the name of sanity is a phylogenetic tree? Well, a phylogenetic tree is **history of the evolution of a certain organism**, for example, the history of the evolution of a bird. One rule is that any organisms that descend from a certain ancestor **belong to the same phlogenetic group, called a monophylogenetic group.** 

### Traditional Classification
This method of classification groups species by two things:
1. A common ancestor
2. Differences in traits.

Now, a common ancestor speaks for itself, but when it comes to traits, then that is where this system diverges; **the fact that species have different traits allows scientists to make different categories for those species based on those different traits.** For example, birds have feathers and mammals have fur, but they share the common ancestor of an amniotic egg. Thus, they are grouped under the same ancestor, but diverge into different classifications as animals that have feathers and animals that have fur.

Now, there is something called a **primitive character**. A primitive character is :exclamation: **a trait that is shared across the common ancestor and the other members of the group** :exclamation:

In contrast, there is a derived character, or **any characteristic that is unique to one particular lineage of the group, and not to the others**. Here is a demonstrated example:

> **EXAMPLE:** Birds and Mammals share the common ancestor of a reptile. However, they diverge when birds evolved feathers and mammals evolved fur. Thus, these two different lineages actually come from a reptile, their common ancestor. 

### Cladistic Classification
> **NOTE:** I'm gonna start using the Cornell Method on **each seperate section** for this lesson only. I am still experimenting with shorter note-taking techniques. 

#### Notes
* Cladistic Classification **is used to group organisms by their derived traits.**
* **Clades** are used to organize these **cladograms**. 
* Traits that are unique to one organism are **NOT** used, because Cladistic Classification organizes based on shared traits.
* Species in a clade are united because of a common trait e.g. A chimp and a mouse are in the same clade because they share the trait of having fur. 

#### Cues
* Derived Traits :point_right: traits that are unique to a particular lineage.
* Clade :point_right: **a group of common life forms and their common ancestor**.


#### Summary
Cladistic Classification organizes organisms based on their derived traits into a cladogram. In these cladograms are clades, which contain species based on their derived traits (e.g. mice and chimps are in one clade because they share fur. Crocs and Birds are in one clade due to sharing some kinda ankle joint.) and as you go up, you can make hypotheses based on these derived traits.
