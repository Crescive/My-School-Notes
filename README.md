# My-School-Notes
This is a personal repository for school notes. Mainly because I like to take my notes in Markdown with Emojis as legend icons.

> **NOTE:** The notes for **9th grade** are quite incomplete because I began to take these notes in the 2nd semester. From 10th grade and onwards they shall be complete.
